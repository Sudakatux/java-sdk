## Notes

The Java Widgets Tools requires Java 1.6+. Since Xapo uses 256 bit encryption keys you may need to download and install the _Java Cryptographic Extensions_ depending to your Java version:

- [Java 6](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html)
- [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

Decompress the zip file and copy the whole contents to ${java.home}/jre/lib/security/.* (overwrite previous files)
